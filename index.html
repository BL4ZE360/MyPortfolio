                                I am a soon-to-be graduate in computer science from the University of Warwick. I currently live in Leamington Spa but will be permanently moving to Papworth Everard from August. During my course, I have quickly learnt and harnessed a variety of programming languages, such as Python, Java, C, JavaScript, HTML and CSS. I enjoy solving problems and utilising various software engineering methodologies to accomplish so. I am looking forward to putting my technical talents and creativity to use in a real-world context and developing as a professional in the fast-paced world of technology.

                                This is my dissertation project. The project is an offline application for users to play Bridge, with a
                                virtual assistant that can guide them into making better decisions. This process rested on three
                                legs: implementing an application to play Bridge, artificial intelligence to serve as the three
                                other players, and a helpful assistant. For a more detailed breakdown, see the side-menu.

                                During my course, I was part of a team that created a web app, named Mento, designed to promote Deutsche Bank's mentoring
                                programme so that employees can build on their technical skills within the company, and the company itself
                                can grow. My part in the team focussed on the project documentation and assisting with pair programming for both the development and testing aspects.
                                Using a blend of Plan-driven and Agile development, we created a smart and efficient app, which was awarded
                                second-best out of the 51 applications Deutsche Bank received.

                                I chose a blend between the Waterfall model and an Agile methodology to allow for stable requirements, but with cycles of fine-tuning the app. The dissertation was formed from four primary components: a Requirements document, a Progress Report, a presentation, and the Final Report. These ensured the project maintained a steady progress to maintain a steady progress throughout the project.

                                The app's key design features were thoroughly planned, and were shortly followed by the base app's implementation. This consisted of a simple setup to play Bridge using JavaScript and HTML. This allowed the user to bid during the bidding phase of the game, and to play cards during the playing phase. For both of these actions, clicking on the lightbulb icon highlight the move for the user to make using a simple box-shadow effect.

                                The assistant's decision process to chose a move is based off the same process that the other 3 AI players use - neural networks. This project uses three different networks to take information from the user's hand and the game so far and creates a probility distribution across possible moves to make, all using Python. To simplify the inputted information, heuristics are used in JavaScript to map the user's hand into its important factors (HCPs).

                                The product was tested through various forms: unit testing, system testing, UI testing, user acceptance testing, and AI testing. The results of these guided the direction of the project and discovered any faults to fix.

                                The app was deployed as a single folder for user simplicity, where they would launch the app like any other desktop application. I used Electron Builder to automate the process, providing a variety of forms to distribute the package.

                                Overall, this project was successful, in that user feedback was very positive and some even began playing Bridge frequently. Additionally, the project maintained a steady workflow, implying a successful methodology.

                                However, some additional features were not implemented due to time constraints, such as an adjustable difficulty level. These features would've broadened the user's experience, but ultimately did not affect their ability to learn Bridge.

                                Mento is a web application that was developed as a group prohect for a module in my second year of university that was run in collaboration with Deutsche Bank. The project brief was to develop a solution that facilitates the employee mentoring program. We were given a specification for the minimum requirements and were given freedom for the app's development, while discussing any additions with the client. We decided to develop the solution as a web application as it would allow for easy access for the Deutsche Bank employees.

                                My role within the team focussed on the project documentation and assisting with pair programming for both the development and testing aspects. Additionally, I helped the project manager with their delegation amongst the team. Our team of 7 had a range of experience in software engineering. Therefore, we opted for a blend of Plan-Driven and Agile development. This was chosen such that the final product satisfied the specification, while the team maintained constant communication. Additionally, we were required to submit the application along with the following documents: Requirements Analysis, Design Plan, Final Report, of which we scored 74%.

                                The app consisted of a login screen, a mentor / mentee pairing system, a chat function, and a group session feature. The users of the app's data such as login details were stored in an SQL database. The backend and frontend of the project primarily relies of Java. Additionally, it uses Spring Boot, Maven and Vaadin to simplify the development, manage dependencies and help provide a modern interface.
