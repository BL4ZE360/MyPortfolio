My personal website ideas:

Display CV fashionably
Links to little projects
Youtube, email etc.
Gallery?
Articles or books I find interesting (fractals lol)


Basic features:
Scrollable - background scrolls slower than text
Gallery 
Width does not change
Needs a url - http://www.matthewhill.com
Sidebar needs to take whole page for smaller screens

Best atm:
http://www.mhillpage.co.uk - domain.com $7 a year


Visuals:
Black background
White text - soft font to start, but spice it up as it goes along
Funky scroll bar, rather than standard google
Three line side panel on top left
First page is NAME with some details or phrase or description about website etc.
Fun little logo looking somewhere between knobbish and dull


Using bootstrap:
